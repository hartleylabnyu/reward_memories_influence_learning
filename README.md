# reward_memories_influence_learning

This repository contains the code required to reproduce the data visualizations and analyses reported in <b><i>Reward-Motivated Memories Influence New Learning Across Development</i></b>.

## Tasks Administered

In order to examine the influence of prior reward associations on new learning, participants first completed a Motivated Encoding Task. Twenty-four hours later, they completed Memory Retrieval Tests followed by a Learning Task with three types of stimulus pairs (previously high-reward, previously low-reward, and novel), and a Test Phase with all possible combinations of stimuli from the Learning Task.

## Data

Data for <i>N</i> = 89 children, adolescent, and adult participants are stored in the <b><i>data</i></b> directory:

<b>Across all .csv files,</b>

* <i>subID</i> - subject ID numbers, as strings

<i>subid</i> - subject ID numbers, as integers

<b>ProcessedDemographicData.csv</b> contains participants' demographic information.

<i>Gender</i> - sex-assigned-at-birth (0 denotes males, 1 denotes females)

<i>ExactAge</i> - age in years

<i>AgeGroup</i> - age in bins (1 denotes adults ages 18-25 years, 2 denotes adolescents ages 13-17 years, 3 denotes children ages 8-12 years)

<i>Race</i> - self-identified race

<i>Ethnicity</i> - self-identified ethnicity

<b>ProcessedLearningData.csv</b> contains participants' choices during the Learning Task.

<i>block</i> - numbered block of 30 trials (1 denotes first 30 trials, 2 denotes second 30 trials, 3 denotes third 30 trials, 4 denotes fourth 30 trials, 5 denotes fifth 30 trials, 6 denotes last 30 trials)

<i>rt</i> - reaction time in ms

<i>RewardCat</i> - whether faces or places were the high-reward category for the participant (e denotes faces, o denotes places); corresponds to the parity of subid

<i>correctresponses</i> - accuracy of the trial-wise response (0 denotes incorrect, 1 denotes correct); defined as choosing the relatively higher reinforced card deck in each pair

<i>StimRewardType</i> - trial type (high denotes trial with a pair of previously high-reward stimuli, low denotes trial with a pair of previously low-reward stimuli, new denotes trial with novel stimuli)

<i>Instance</i> - presentation order of each trial type (e.g., "the second time a low trial type was seen by the participant")

<b>ProcessedMemoryData.csv</b> contains participants' memory performance from the Memory Retrieval Tests.

<b>ProcessedTestData.csv</b> contains participants' choices during the Test Phase.

## Scripts

The analysis code is stored in the <b><i>scripts</i></b> directory:

<b>MotER_Learning_PlotFormatting.R</b> includes common plotting variables; this script gets called by the .Rmd file below.

<b>MotER_Learning.Rmd</b> reproduces the data visualizations and analyses; this script relies on the .R file above, creates the .html file below, and calls .rda objects from their subdirectory.

<b>MotER_Learning.html</b> presents the data visualization and analysis outputs, as specified in the .Rmd file above.

<b><i>rda_files</i></b> stores fitted linear mixed-effects model outputs as .rda objects, corresponding to the R and package versions the authors used in their analyses.

## Figures

The data visualizations and analyses, summarized in .png plots and .html tables, are stored in the <b><i>figures</i></b> directory.

## R and Key Package Versions

Data processing and analyses were conducted in R version 3.6.2 (R Core Team, 2019). Linear mixed-effects models were run using the “glmer” function in the “lme4” package (version 1.1-23; (Bates et al. 2014)).
